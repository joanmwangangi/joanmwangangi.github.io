<p>I <strong>love</strong> video games. It is what I look forward to <em>every</em> week when I have free time after school or work. My favourite video game generes are as follows:</p>

 <ul>
   <li>Role-Playing Games (RPG)</li>
   <li>Action-Adventure Games</li>
   <li>Open World Games</li>
   <li>First Person Shooter Games (FPS)</li>
   <li>Real-Time Strtegey Games (RTS)</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Role-Playing Games</h2>

<p>Let's start with Role Playing Games or RPG for short. A RPG  is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting, or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character development. My top 5 favorite RPG games are as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Pokemon</li>
    <li>Child of Light</li>
    <li>Path of Exile</li>
    <li>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2</li>
    <li>South Park: The Stick of Truth</li>
  </ol>
