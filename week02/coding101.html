<h1>My Favorite Korean Drama: <u>Crash Landing On You</u></h1>




<p>My <strong>favorite</strong> Kdrama is Crash Landing on You. From the mention of mental illness, love, death, hesrtbreak and to each character truly desrving every ounce of camera time and your eyes glued on them, even the <em> villians</em>. A few of the actors in the show include:</p>

 <ul>
   <li>Seo Ji-Hye</li>
   <li>Hyun-Bin</li>
   <li>Son Ye-Jins</li>
   <li>Kim Jung-Hyun</li>
   <li>Yoo Su-Bin</li>
   <li>Yang Kyung-Won and <u>many</u> more....</li>
  </ul>
